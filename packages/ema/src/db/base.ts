/**
 * Database interfaces for EverMemoryArchive.
 *
 * + We associate roles with prompt and assets.
 * + We can clone roles to create actor entities. Each actor entity has a unique state, such as memory buffer.
 * + We can create users to access multiple actor entities.
 * + We can create conversations with actors. The conversations are not the same as the conversations in the system,
 *   but the messages array passed to the llm agent when calling openai APIs (`chat.completions.create`).
 * + We can create conversation messages, associated with a conversation.
 * + We can create short term memories for actors. The short term memories are associated with conversation messages (
 *   for debugging purpose).
 * + We can create long term memories for actors. The long term memories are associated with conversation messages (
 *   for debugging purpose).
 * + We can search long term memories. We can have multiple implementations, such as text-based searcher, vector-
 *   based searcher.
 *
 * All of the above interfaces, except the searcher, are implemented in mongo db. The searcher can be implemented by backends other
 * than mongo, like elasticsearch.
 *
 * See:
 * - {@link RoleDB}
 * - {@link ActorDB}
 * - {@link UserDB}
 * - {@link UserOwnActorDB}
 * - {@link ConversationDB}
 * - {@link ConversationMessageDB}
 * - {@link ShortTermMemoryDB}
 * - {@link LongTermMemoryDB}
 * - {@link LongTermMemorySearcher}
